# HR Data Cleaning for Analysis
### Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and preprocessing a raw HR employee dataset to make it suitable for analysis. The primary goal was to address common data quality issues, including missing values, incorrect data types, and inconsistent formatting.

### Dataset
The project utilizes a synthetic dataset named hr_dataset.csv, which contains 1500 employee records across eight columns.
The dataset includes the following intentional issues:
* Missing values in the Age, Salary, and Gender columns.
* Inconsistent text formats in the Department column.
* Non-numeric entries in the Salary column.

### Project Structure
* HR_data.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the project code.
* hr_dataset.csv: The raw dataset.

### Project Execution
To run the project, simply open the HR_data.ipynb notebook in a Python environment such as Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code with the Python extension and run all the cells sequentially. The required libraries are listed in the notebook.

### Key Outcomes
* Successfully handled missing data using statistical methods.
* Corrected all data types and standardized text formatting.
* Generated visualizations from the cleaned data, proving its readiness for further analysis.
